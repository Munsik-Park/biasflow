# Test: inert/delete cleanup RED/GREEN harness — Issue #799
# ([#785-S11b] 비활성화된 multi-repo 기계 일괄 정리)
# =============================================================================
# Tier-1 scripted assertion suite per verification design
# (.autoflow/issue-799-verification-design.md). Docs/chore change (no jest,
# no npm) — mirrors tests/test-issue-798-topology-flip.sh /
# tests/test-issue-797-doc-invocation.sh: assert_true/assert_false over
# grep -F + git diff.
#
# Canonical AC numbering (ledger E4 / feature §4.7 R2 / verification §6 C1):
# feature AC1-AC12 (D-ID-keyed) are the top-level names; the assert labels
# below use the verification design's Group A-H sub-oracle ids
# (AC1-neg/pos, AC2-*, AC3-*, AC5D/G/H-*, AC6-*), bound to feature AC1-AC12
# by the §6 crosswalk table. One id set binds RED/GREEN.
#
# Scope (verification design §2 Tier-1):
#   AC1-neg/pos   README-CONSUMED-PRESENT   (feat AC1, D1)
#   AC2-neg/pos   README-LEGACY-ANNOTATION-ABSENT (feat AC2, D2)
#   AC2-tree      structure-tree spot subset (feat AC2, D2)

#   AC5D-maint-neg  maintained-docs neutralize-in-place (feat AC6, D5)
#   AC4-guard     no broken host-scoped link introduced (preservation)

#   AC1-e2e   already covered by tests/plugin/verify-e2e-dummy-target.sh
#             (init.sh --target E2E) — reuse, no new harness
#

# keystone): AC1-neg (wizard narrative present), AC1-pos (--target /
# /plugin absent), AC2-neg (template-era x2 present), AC3-guide/common/ext
# (self-claim present, no #798 qualifier), AC3D-checklist-neg/section-neg
# (legacy strings present), AC5D-index-neg (services/librechat/docs/
# present), AC5D-maint-neg (N/A qualifier absent), AC5G-neg (deferred to
# S11a present) all FAIL. AC3-guard/AC4-guard/AC5H-degenerate/AC5H-nosubmod/
# AC5G-guard are preservation guards and PASS both pre- and post-change.
# AC6-scope/AC6-ci become GREEN only once the suite + CI wiring land.

  # Explicit forbidden-file negative arm (feature §2 'Not touched' hard
  # constraints / §5 dependency guards).
  # Re-anchored for #846 (same remedy class as the #794 window re-anchors,
  # precedents 2a0dae3 / 3396d7f): #846's GATE:PLAN-passed design §2.4
  # legitimately amends ONE CLAUDE.md clause — the Regressions-line cap
  # sentence ('Codex review auto-resolution (Medium+ found at HANDOFF)').
  # The #799 concern is unchanged: no OTHER CLAUDE.md content may change on
  # this branch. So instead of a blanket file ban, assert every changed
  # content line (+/-) in CLAUDE.md's diff belongs to that one sentence.
  # #848 window extension (same remedy class as the #846 re-anchor above):
  # #848's GATE:PLAN-passed design (ledger E11/E12) adds ONE approved
  # CLAUDE.md line — the Commit Ownership 'Submodule pointer bump' row
  # (committer = Orchestrator). Every other CLAUDE.md content change on
  # this branch remains forbidden.
  # #844 amends two more CLAUDE.md clauses (feature design §2: Regressions
  # cap-semantics wording clarified, GATE:PLAN's own Human-escalation
  # example folded into the per-gate cap read, and the PR Wait Rule's
  # requested-issue mode line gains a Resume-procedure cross-reference).
  # Same remedy as the #846 carve-out above: admit the specific edited
  # clauses by a substring common to BOTH the old and new line (not the
  # whole line, so any *other* future edit to these sentences still trips
  # the guard).
  # #978 amends two more CLAUDE.md clauses (AutoFlow State Tracking,
  # delete->archive rewrite): the ledger-companion sentence ("deleted with
  # it" -> "archived with it (moved to the external store)") and the
  # Completion sentence ("deletes" -> "archives ... $AUTOFLOW_ARCHIVE_ROOT").
  # Same carve-out shape — substrings common to both the old and new lines.
  # #985 amends five more CLAUDE.md lines (public-release identifier
  # generalization sweep, ledger Q1): the {{GITHUB_ORG}} placeholder example
  # org (the pre-sweep ontology-platform org example -> `my-service-org`),
  # the GATE:PLAN and GATE:QUALITY revert-rule evidence citations (the
  # pre-sweep owner/repo pair -> `Munsik-Park/autoflow#N` / bare `LibreChat
  # #268`), the sub-repo PR close-keyword example (`Part of` the pre-sweep
  # owner/repo pair `#N` -> `Part of Munsik-Park/autoflow#N`), and the Backlog
  # tracker-placement paragraph
  # (folds the removed Forward-routing paragraph's org identifiers into one
  # generalized sentence). Same carve-out shape as the #844/#978 entries
  # above — substrings common to both old and new lines where a line is
  # edited in place, full literal old+new lines where a line is
  # replaced/removed outright — so any *other* future edit to these
  # sentences still trips the guard.
  # #26 amends four CLAUDE.md clauses in place and inserts one row (VERIFY →
  # ARCHITECT design-contradiction route, feature design §2.1/§2.2/§2.3/§2.4/
  # §2.9): the Flow Control deadlock row gains the arbitration's outcome
  # enumeration, a new `VERIFY → ARCHITECT` row is inserted after it, the
  # `GREEN → VERIFY` entry condition admits the mutually-unsatisfiable case,
  # the Regressions line's GATE:PLAN clause folds the re-deliberation into the
  # existing cap, and the Human-escalation clause is narrowed. Same carve-out
  # shape as #844/#978/#985 — a substring common to BOTH the old and new line
  # for each in-place edit, plus one for the pure insertion. The #26
  # Human-escalation substring below REPLACES the pre-#26 full-sentence-pair
  # entry: §2.3 splits that pair, so the old entry would match neither line
  # and would survive only as a dead filter silently pre-authorising a future
  # edit that restores the unqualified escalation sentence (ledger E21).
