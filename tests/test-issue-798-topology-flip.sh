# Test: submodule-detach topology-flip RED/GREEN harness — Issue #798
# ([#785-S11a] 토폴로지 플립)
# =============================================================================
# Tier-1 scripted assertion suite per verification design
# (.autoflow/issue-798-verification-design.md). Docs+config change (no jest,
# no npm) — mirrors tests/test-issue-795-handoff-removal.sh /
# tests/test-issue-797-doc-invocation.sh: assert_true/assert_false over
# git-plumbing + grep.
#
# [MUST] Git-plumbing, not filesystem. Every detach assertion queries
# HEAD/the index (`git ls-tree`, `git ls-files -s`, `git config --file
# .gitmodules`), never a working-tree filesystem probe — `git rm --cached
# services` leaves `services/` on disk as an untracked local checkout, and a
# CI fresh clone has no `services/` at all. Filesystem probes would give
# environment-sensitive, non-reproducible RED/GREEN (verification design §0
# / R1).
#
# Scope (verification design §1/§2):
#   AC1  GITMODULES-CLEAR   — .gitmodules absent from HEAD (D-1 = delete)
#   AC2  GITLINK-CLEAR      — no 160000 gitlink at `services` in HEAD/index
#   AC3  COUNT-ZERO         — non-vacuity keystone: submodule count == 0
#   AC5  DOC-CLAUDE-CLASS   — CLAUDE.md:42 self-classification flipped
#   AC6  DOC-SECONDARY-COHERENCE (guard) — dual-mode definitions + Secondary
#        markers preserved
#   AC7  ADR-HISTORICAL-KEEP (guard) — ADR-0015:148 kept verbatim
#   AC9  NO-NEW-TIMING (guard)      — no new hook/workflow timing mechanism
#   AC10 SCOPE-CONTAINMENT (guard) — diff ⊆ the enumerated flip-caused set
#   AC12 CI-ENFORCED        — the suite + `.gitmodules` are CI-registered
#   AC15 README-SYNC        — README.md dangling submodule references removed
#        (GATE:QUALITY E11 remediation, ledger E11): no --recurse-submodules
#        clone instruction, no structure-tree `(git submodule)` entry; the
#        generic framework dual-mode prose (line 76) is a preserved guard.
#
# Not in this file (verification design §2/§5):
#   AC4  local .git/config + .git/modules residue        → tests/manual/issue-798-manual-scenarios.md
#   AC8  HANDOFF reclassification (behavioral)            → tests/manual/issue-798-manual-scenarios.md
#   AC11 host-purity DELTA regression (reuse, unchanged)  → tests/test-issue-788-host-purity-delta.sh
#   AC13 resync-submodules.sh clean run-through           → DEFERRED: verification design §2 item 4
#        states this is added "only after the D-2 guard lands" — the oracle
#        needs the script's empty-gm_names fix in place (D-2) before it can
#        assert exit-0 run-through instead of pipefail-abort. Adding it now
#        against the live (still-populated) .gitmodules would be vacuously
#        GREEN (today's script never reaches the empty-gm_names branch),
#        which is not a valid RED. Add at VERIFY once GREEN lands D-2.
#   AC14 purity-ratchet burn-down (reuse) — feature §5 confirms the
#        conditional is structurally unreachable for #798 (no baseline entry
#        references `services`); stays GREEN unconditionally via
#        tests/plugin/verify-e2e-dummy-target.sh E2a arm, no new assertion.
#
# RED expectation (pre-change): AC1/AC2/AC3/AC5(negative present + positive
# absent)/AC12 FAIL. AC3 COUNT-ZERO is the non-vacuity keystone — a
# pre-change PASS on any detach assertion means the test is mis-scoped.
# AC6/AC7/AC9/AC10 are preservation guards and PASS both pre- and post-change.
