# Test: subagent run_in_background prohibition doc-assertion guard — Issue #955
# =============================================================================
# Tier-1 scripted assertion suite per verification design
# (.autoflow/issue-955-verification-design.md). Docs/ops change (no jest, no
# npm) — mirrors tests/test-issue-949-manifest-regen-doc.sh /
# tests/test-issue-800-doc-assertions.sh: assert_true/assert_false over
# grep/awk section extraction + git-diff + jq + comm.
#
# Placement (feature design §0, ratified branch): the canonical [MUST] clause
# lives in docs/teammate-common-rules.md (single-repo-correct "all teammates"
# home) and is mirrored verbatim in docs/submodule-common-rules.md (the
# issue's originally-named surface). This suite asserts the RATIFIED
# two-surface branch. If a later cycle reverts to the fallback
# (submodule-common-rules.md only), AC1-a-canonical and
# AC1-a-mirror-equality are dropped per the verification design's stated
# fallback note.
#
# Scope (verification design §1, Tier 1):
#   AC1-a-canonical    — RED discriminator: docs/teammate-common-rules.md
#                        carries a new "## Bash Execution Mode" section with a
#                        [MUST] clause naming run_in_background, foreground,
#                        and teammate/subagent.
#   AC1-a-mirror       — RED discriminator: docs/submodule-common-rules.md
#                        carries the mirrored "### Bash execution mode"
#                        subsection (under Testing Standards) with the same
#                        tokens plus a canonical cross-link to
#                        teammate-common-rules.md > Bash Execution Mode.
#   AC1-a-mirror-equality — guard: the canonical and mirror clause bodies are
#                        byte-identical for the normative sentence (mirror's
#                        cross-link line stripped before diff). Vacuously
#                        empty (PASS) pre-edit — neither body exists yet.
#   AC1-b              — RED discriminator: each of the five
#                        .claude/agents/autoflow-*.md files carries a
#                        Hard-rules bullet with run_in_background + foreground.
#   AC1-c              — RED discriminator: docs/teammate-contracts.md carries
#                        run_in_background + foreground + an in-script/
#                        workflows/* token (explicit facilitator-scope
#                        coverage, not left to transitive inheritance).
#   AC1-d              — RED discriminator: the same canonical phrase
#                        (run_in_background co-located with foreground within
#                        one clause) appears in all three doc surfaces
#                        (teammate-common-rules.md, submodule-common-rules.md,
#                        teammate-contracts.md) — one rule, placed thrice.
#   AC1-counterpart    — RED discriminator: CLAUDE.md Execution Principles
#                        states the background+idle-notification pattern is
#                        orchestrator/main-loop-only, justified by the
#                        future-turn lifecycle contract.
#   AC2                — RED discriminator: CLAUDE.md Teammate-idle-handling
#                        bullet is extended with the "Done + no report → shell
#                        verify, don't wait" direct-spawn reading.
#   AC3                — RED discriminator: docs/autoflow-guide.md REFINE AND
#                        VERIFY sections both carry a short-verification
#                        direct-/foreground-execution note.
#   AC4                — Green-state guard (949 precedent): the five manifest
#                        source files this cycle touches (teammate-common-
#                        rules.md, submodule-common-rules.md,
#                        teammate-contracts.md, CLAUDE.md, autoflow-guide.md)
#                        trigger a same-commit setup/manifest.json regen.
#                        Vacuously true pre-GREEN (empty diff intersection).
#   AC5-a/b/c          — RED discriminators: the canonical clause literally
#                        covers the reproducer — both entry paths (direct-spawn
#                        + in-script) named, the actor's OWN verification run
#                        named, and the clause is normatively [MUST].
#   CI registration    — RED discriminator: this suite is wired into
#                        .github/workflows/e2e-dummy-target.yml (both `paths:`
#                        trigger blocks + a `run:` step), #800/#949 precedent.
#   AC-SCOPE           — guard: git diff --name-only ⊆ this cycle's allow-list.
#   AC-PRESERVE        — guard: existing REFINE/VERIFY/Reporting-Format/idle
#                        content survives (no wholesale deletion).
#   DC-4               — Green-follow guard: tests/test-issue-794-doc-
#                        assertions.sh still exits 0 after the CLAUDE.md /
#                        autoflow-guide.md line-shifting edits land (its four
#                        first_line_in_range windows re-anchored in the same
#                        cycle if broken).
#
# Cycle 2 (review-response, PR #958 Codex Medium Finding 1 — see
# .autoflow/issue-955-c2-verification-design.md / -c2-feature-design.md):
#   AC-C2-1            — RED discriminator: the 9 runtime-reachable prompt
#                        strings across .claude/workflows/architect-
#                        deliberation.js (6: dev-draft, test-draft, dev-r,
#                        test-r, both ledger ternary branches) and
#                        verify-cause-branch.js (3: test-self-check,
#                        impl-self-check, ledger) each carry
#                        run_in_background / foreground / the "Bash Execution
#                        Mode" pointer, ONLY on non-comment (prompt-literal)
#                        lines, with the two architect ledger branches
#                        independently anchor-bound (the clause must co-occur
#                        with the "ARCHITECT mutual ACCEPT" line AND with the
#                        "ARCHITECT non-convergence" line — a file-total or
#                        vicinity count is maldistribution-blind, DC-2). A
#                        structural agent( site-count tripwire (5 architect /
#                        3 verify) is kept as a change-detector, not the
#                        discriminator.
#   AC-C2-2            — RED discriminator: this suite reads both workflow
#                        scripts by absolute path (the AC-C2-1 assertions ARE
#                        this AC).
#   AC-C2-3            — guard: AC-SCOPE allow-list admits the two workflow
#                        scripts (co-lands with the edit, else AC-SCOPE FAILs
#                        once they are touched).
#   AC-C2-4            — no new assertion; the existing AC4 manifest-dogfood
#                        block already generalizes (both .js files are
#                        manifest sources).
#   G-REG              — Green-follow guard (NOT a RED discriminator):
#                        node test/workflows/run.mjs (CI job
#                        workflow-regression) must stay green; prompt edits
#                        are pure appends and must not perturb the pinned
#                        control-flow / substring assertions.
#
# DC-4 KNOWN PRE-EXISTING BASELINE ANOMALY (verified this round, unrelated to
# #955): tests/test-issue-794-doc-assertions.sh already exits 1 at this
# cycle's own merge-base with main (`git diff main --stat` is empty on this
# branch prior to any #955 edit) — 55/57 passed, 2 FAILed
# ("autoflow-guide.md HANDOFF step 4: host-only lead precedes secondary
# sub-repo bullet" and "autoflow-guide.md Merge Sequencing: target-centric
# intro precedes secondary 5-step lead", both inside the exact 526-532 /
# 573-592 windows #955 will shift). This is a pre-existing baseline defect,
# NOT caused by #955 and NOT one of #955's RED discriminators — DC-4 is
# implemented exactly per the verification design's stated oracle (suite exits
# 0) so it surfaces as an already-FAILing assertion pre-edit, contradicting
# the verification design's "PASS pre-edit" assumption for this one guard.
# Reported as a discrepancy in the RED report; not silently weakened.
#
# Not in this file (verification design §2, manual residue):
#   AC5 semantic residue — "literally covers with no interpretation gap" is a
#     reading judgment the grep cannot fully settle; manual acceptance step.
#   E1 self-referential dispatch — orchestrator inspects its own dispatch
#     payload; no repo artifact to grep.
#
# RED expectation (pre-edit, this commit, per verification design §5): FAIL —
# AC1-a-canonical, AC1-a-mirror, AC1-a-mirror-equality(vacuous PASS, see
# below), AC1-b, AC1-c, AC1-d, AC1-counterpart, AC2, AC3, AC5-a, AC5-b, AC5-c,
# CI registration.
#
# JUSTIFIED PRE-EDIT PASSES (guards, NOT RED discriminators):
#   AC1-a-mirror-equality — vacuous PASS pre-edit (neither clause body exists
#     yet, so the diff of two empty bodies is empty).
#   AC4 (manifest dogfood) — vacuous PASS pre-edit (empty diff intersection).
#   AC-SCOPE               — PASS pre-edit (empty diff ⊆ any allow-list).
#   AC-PRESERVE             — PASS pre-edit (nothing removed yet).
#   DC-4                    — see the KNOWN PRE-EXISTING BASELINE ANOMALY note
#     above: this guard is ALREADY FAIL pre-edit for reasons outside #955's
#     scope, not because of #955.
#
# CYCLE 2 RED expectation (pre-edit, this commit, per
# .autoflow/issue-955-c2-verification-design.md §4): all cycle-1 assertions
# above are already GREEN at this HEAD (cycle-1 landed in PR #958). The new
# cycle-2 discriminator, AC-C2-1 (token presence + non-comment clause count +
# both ledger-branch anchors), FAILs pre-edit — 0 matches for
# run_in_background/foreground/Bash Execution Mode in either workflow script.
# AC-C2-2 (suite reads both paths) PASSes as soon as this commit lands (files
# exist). AC-C2-1 tripwire (5/3 agent( sites) and G-REG
# (test/workflows/run.mjs exits 0) are guards that already PASS pre-edit and
# must stay green post-edit.
